    (reload): reload the grammar/parameters
    (grammar): prints out the grammar
    (params [|file|]): dumps all the model parameters

    (accept |candidate index|): record the |index|-th candidate as the correct answer for the last utterance.
    (answer |answer|): record |answer| as the correct answer for the last utterance (e.g., (answer (list (number 3)))).
    (rule |lhs| (|rhs_1| ... |rhs_k|) |sem|): adds a rule to the grammar (e.g., (rule $Number ($TOKEN) (NumberFn)))
    (type |logical form|): perform type inference (e.g., (type (number 3)))
    (execute |logical form|): execute the logical form (e.g., (execute (call + (number 3) (number 4))))
    (def |key| |value|): define a macro to replace |key| with |value| in all commands (e.g., (def type fb:type.object type)))
